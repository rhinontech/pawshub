# PawsHub — Product, UX, and Engineering Documentation

## 1. Product Overview

**Product name:** PawsHub  
**Platform:** Mobile app  
**Stack:** Expo, React Native, NativeWind, Gluestack UI  
**Primary users:** Pet parents, adopters, rescue volunteers, foster caregivers, and veterinary discovery users

PawsHub is a mobile-first pet care platform that combines **pet health tracking**, **nearby vet discovery**, **adoption workflows**, and a **pet community** into one app.

The core idea is simple:

> One app to manage a pet’s life — from vaccines and checkups to adoption and community support.

Most pet apps solve only one part of the journey:
- reminder apps handle vaccines and medications
- maps apps help find vets
- adoption apps list pets
- social apps create community

PawsHub combines all of these in a single, trustworthy system.

---

## 2. Vision

Build the most useful everyday app for pet parents and future pet parents.

PawsHub should feel:
- warm
- trustworthy
- organized
- modern
- calm
- premium but friendly

The app should reduce anxiety for pet owners by making it easy to:
- remember health events
- organize pet records
- find nearby care
- connect with nearby pet people
- safely manage adoptions

---

## 16.1 Frontend stack
- Expo

- Gluestack UI
- TypeScript
- React Query or TanStack Query
- Zustand or Context for lightweight local app state
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms

## 16.2 Backend suggestions
Pick one of these:
- Supabase
- Firebase
- Node.js + PostgreSQL

---

## 18. Recommended Navigation Structure

### Tabs
- Home
- Pets
- Discover
- Community
- Profile

### Stacks
Each tab can own its stack, for example:

  - Home
  - Notifications
  - QuickAction screens

- selected pet
- notification status
- location permission state
- theme tokens if needed

### Server state
- pet records
- vet listings
- adoption listings
- community posts

### Form state
Use React Hook Form + Zod.

---

## 20. API / Service Modules

### Auth service
- signUp
- signIn

- getCurrentUser

### Pets service
- createPet
- updatePet
- deletePet
- listPets
- getPetById

### Health service
- addVaccine
- listVaccines

## 21. Notifications Strategy

### Reminder events

### Push notification examples
- Bella’s rabies vaccine is due tomorrow.
- Bruno has medication scheduled at 8:00 PM.
- You received a new adoption application.
- Someone replied to your community post.

---

## 22. Empty State Strategy

Important because users may start with no pets, no records, or no posts.

### Examples
- No pets yet → “Add your first pet to start tracking care.”
- No vaccines logged → “Add vaccine history to stay on schedule.”
- No nearby vets found → “Try a wider location range.”
- No saved adoption posts → “Browse pets looking for a home.”

Empty states should include one action button.

---

## 23. Permissions

### Required

- media library / camera
- location

### Permission timing
Ask only when the feature is needed, not all at once.

---

## 24. Accessibility

### Requirements

- good contrast against blue-900 theme
- tap targets at least 44x44
- icon + label, not icon only where possible
- semantic roles for buttons

- error messages clear and visible

---

## 25. Security and Trust

Because the app handles pet medical records and adoption profiles, trust is critical.

### Requirements
- secure auth

- moderation on adoption/community posts
- report/block flow
- safe image upload rules
- privacy-first defaults
- no public contact details without consent

---

## 33. Risks and Considerations

### Product risks
- too many features in MVP
- unclear primary use case
- adoption trust and moderation burden
- local vet data accuracy
- users dropping off before adding pet details

### Mitigation
- anchor app around pet health dashboard first
- keep community and adoption scoped
- use curated local data sources
- make onboarding very short
- prioritize reminders and records for retention

## 34. Success Metrics

### Product health metrics
- onboarding completion rate
- pet creation completion rate
- week-1 retention
- number of reminders created per user
- number of active pets per user
- adoption application conversion rate
- community post creation rate

### MVP success target
A strong MVP proves that users return for care tracking, not just one-time browsing.
